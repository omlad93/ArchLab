# ArchLab  
<br>Computer Architecture Course:
Iris Taubkin & Omri Elad

## Lab01: simple cpu simulation in C
<br>simple state machine CPU (no pipeline)
## Lab02: pipelined cpu simulation in C
<br>Same ISA like lab1 but pipelined, additional DMA
## Lab03: verilog implementation of pretty basic blocks
<br> Verilog implemantation of: MUX, HA, FA, ADD4, SUBADD4, CONTER, PARITY, FIFO
## Lab04: verilog implemetation of a cpu
<br> Verilog implentation of CPU simulated in Lab02

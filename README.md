<br>Computer Architecture Course:
Iris Taubkin & Omri Elad

## Lab01: simple cpu simulation in C
Simple state machine CPU (no pipeline)  

## Lab02: pipelined cpu simulation in C
Same ISA like lab1 but pipelined, additional DMA  

## Lab03: verilog implementation of pretty basic blocks
Verilog implemantation of: MUX, HA, FA, ADD4, SUBADD4, CONTER, PARITY, FIFO  

## Lab04: verilog implemetation of a cpu
Verilog implentation of CPU simulated in Lab02

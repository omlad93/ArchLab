## Lab01: simple cpu simulation in C
Simple state machine CPU (no pipeline) [100]

## Lab02: pipelined cpu simulation in C
Same ISA like lab1 but pipelined, additional DMA  [100]

## Lab03: verilog implementation of pretty basic blocks
Verilog implemantation of: MUX, HA, FA, ADD4, SUBADD4, CONTER, PARITY, FIFO  [100]

## Lab04: verilog implemetation of a cpu
Verilog implentation of CPU simulated in Lab02  

## Lab05: pipelined (full throughput) cpu simulation in C
Same like lab2 but multiple instruction in different stages (additional DMA)
